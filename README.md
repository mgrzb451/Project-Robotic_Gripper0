# Robotic Gripper End-Effector Design & Analysis in NX & Simcenter 3D
The aim of this simple project is (as always, mostly to learn new stuff) to design an effective Gripper that can be easily, quickly and cheaply manufactured. I have seen a tonne of designs that look cool but are simply unmanufacturable. Let's design something better!
## Design Goals
- driving mechanism visible (so it looks cool in pictures; what? 🤷🏻‍♂️)
- parts manufacturable with conventional methods (Additive I'm coming for you soon :D)
- **easy** to produce, assemble, maintain, replace and service. No ridiculous tolerances!
- grip a _block_ shaped object between 20 and 50mm wide with a mass of 5kg

# 2D concept
First we create a simple 2D concept and use the amazing capabilities of NX Animation Designer ❤ to determine the appropriate dimensions for the various components of the gripper and make sure it will work

# 3D design
Now we are ready to proceed with the design

# Validation and Analysis
We designed the various elements of the gripper in accordance to design goals and with the best DFM practices for the chosen methods in mind. Now let's perform some analysis to see if the initial design meets the strength requirements and see how it can be optimized.

## Manual Analysis
Let's create a simplified **Free Body Diagram** and calculate the _Reaction Forces_ and required _Servo Motor Torque_

Yeah, I wasn't really thinking about the specifics in terms of mass of the object...That's one strong micro servo 😅

## Motion Simulation
We can use Simcenter 3D Motion Simulation to check our manual analysis and also determine the _Jaw Angle - Gripping Force Curve_

### Motor Torque
That's right! The manual analysis assumed the design was "flat". Whereas in the simulation the force is applied in the center of the Contact Pad resulting in a moment along the Z axis **as well as the X axis**!

### Angle - Force Curve
We can use data extracted from a Dynamic Motion Simulation to see that the Gripping Force generated by the gripper is very close to constant throught its range of motion. Awesome! 😄

## Finite Element Analysis
Due to large uncertainty in regards to the nature of loading and the dynamic characteristics of operation a large **Factor of Safety** was applied

### Displacement Results
We can observe that the displacements are in general not insignificant but given the excessive force used for this analysis and the fact that the largest values are localized on the extreme edges of the pads I'd say it's not bad for the 1st iteration 👍🏻

### Stress Results
The Contour Plot limits show the Re of aluminium we used. The stresses in the links, arms and our structural components are very low - great sign with even better implications!

### Strain Energy Results
We can use the Strain Energy contour plot to guide design optimizations in further iterations. We can see that adding additional stiffeners (in the form of pins for example) in the centers of the Links and towards the rear of the arms 
would greatly stiffen the design without adding much cost or complexity

# Conclusions
### #1
The results seem to show an interesting situation where major individual components are far too strong but the structure itself could use some more rigidity.
This is great news as it show that the design can be vastly improved in terms of light weighting through aggressive material removal.
To address the deformations that we observed additional stiffening elements should be included.
These would ideally be normalized hardware-type elements like additional pins, bushings etc.
They would hardly complicate the design at all and the additional cost will be minimal since that's cheap stuff. Awesome! 😁
### #2 
This project shows the incalculable (pun intended 😏) value of simulation driven design. Performing even cursory FEA at early stages of the design process can yield profound insights translating to significant optimizations in the resulting product!
